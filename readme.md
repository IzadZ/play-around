# Prisma test

## Run app

1. To run the app, you simply need to open the /dist/index.html file in any browser
2. You can now play around ( eg: change some url params)

#### Filters

There are 2 filters available _eyeColor_ and _age_.

- You can for example change eyeColor to green to see it functionning.
